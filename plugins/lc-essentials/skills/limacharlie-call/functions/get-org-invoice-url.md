## What This Skill Does

This skill retrieves invoice information for a specific billing period from a LimaCharlie organization. It calls the LimaCharlie billing API to get either a download URL for the invoice PDF or detailed invoice data in various formats (JSON, CSV). The response format depends on the optional format parameter.

## Required Information

Before calling this skill, gather:

**IMPORTANT**: The Organization ID (OID) is a UUID (like `c1ffedc0-ffee-4a1e-b1a5-abc123def456`), **NOT** the organization name. If you don't have the OID, use the `list_user_orgs` skill first to get the OID from the organization name.
- **oid**: Organization ID (required)
- **year**: Invoice year (required, e.g., 2023)
- **month**: Invoice month (required, 1-12)

Optional parameters:
- **format**: Response format (optional)
  - Omit or empty string = PDF download URL (default)
  - "json" = Full Stripe Invoice object with all details
  - "simple_json" = Simplified line items array
  - "simple_csv" = CSV format invoice data

## How to Use

### Step 1: Validate Parameters

Ensure you have:
1. Valid organization ID (oid)
2. Valid year (2000-3000 range)
3. Valid month (1-12)
4. Optional format choice based on need

### Step 2: Call the Tool

Use the `lc_call_tool` MCP tool from the `limacharlie` server:

```
mcp__limacharlie__lc_call_tool(
  tool_name="get_org_invoice_url",
  parameters={
    "oid": "[organization-id]",
    "year": [year],
    "month": [month],
    "format": "[format]"  // Optional
  }
)
```

**Tool Details:**
- Tool name: `get_org_invoice_url`
- Required parameters:
  - `oid` (string): Organization ID
  - `year` (integer): Invoice year
  - `month` (integer): Invoice month (1-12)
- Optional parameters:
  - `format` (string): "json", "simple_json", "simple_csv", or omit for URL

### Step 3: Handle the Response

The tool returns different structures based on format:

**Default (URL format):**
```json
{
  "url": "https://invoice-download-url.stripe.com/..."
}
```

**JSON format:**
```json
{
  "invoice": {
    "id": "in_1234567890",
    "amount_due": 500000,
    "currency": "usd",
    "lines": [...],
    "period_start": 1640995200,
    "period_end": 1643673600
  }
}
```

**Simple JSON format:**
```json
{
  "lines": [
    {
      "description": "Enterprise Plan",
      "amount": 400000,
      "quantity": 1
    },
    {
      "description": "Additional Sensors",
      "amount": 100000,
      "quantity": 500
    }
  ]
}
```

**Success:**
- URL format returns downloadable link (expires after time)
- JSON formats return detailed invoice structure
- Amounts are typically in cents (divide by 100 for dollars)
- Simple formats easier to parse and display

**Common Errors:**
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid year/month values
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions - requires admin/owner access
- **404 Not Found**: No invoice exists for specified month (org may not have been billed yet)
- **500 Server Error**: Billing API issue - retry or contact support

### Step 4: Format the Response

Present the result to the user:
- For URL format: Provide download link with expiration note
- For JSON formats: Parse and display line items clearly
- Convert amounts from cents to dollars
- Show billing period and total amount
- Format dates in readable format
- Highlight any credits or adjustments
